# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.5.2 — 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Xatab** (Games) — repacks from byxatab.com
- **TorrentGalaxy / TGx** (Movies) — HTML search with seeders
- **Torlock** (TV) — searchable TV index with seeders
- **AniLibria** (Anime) — official API v3 with RU titles and swarm stats
- Desktop CLI launch: `torlink "magnet:..."` or `torlink file.torrent` queues download on startup
- Search filter **Seeded only** (toggle in results view, hotkey `a`)

### Changed
- Source metadata lives in `meta.ts` only; adapters export `search` via `buildSource()`
- EZTV filters latest API pages by title when you type a query (no longer browse-only)
- BitTorrented Movies/TV split results by release name patterns (no duplicate rows)

### Removed
- Unused Node helpers `src/util/clipboard.ts` and `src/util/openFolder.ts` (GUI uses `desktop.ts`)

### Notes
- TGx may return GalaxyFence (captcha) errors; the search continues with other sources

## 1.5.1 — 2026-07-11

### Added
- Each torrent downloads into its own subfolder under the configured download directory
- BitTorrented search source for Movies and TV (synced from upstream 1.4.0)
- EZTV "browse only" badge in search source strip
- Settings hint for per-torrent subfolders and restart notice when changing download folder

### Changed
- UI refresh: Vercel/Geist dark theme — neutral surfaces, white primary buttons, `#333` borders
- HTTP(S) tracker endpoints in default magnets for networks that block UDP (upstream 1.4.0)
- 1337x remembers its last working mirror between searches (upstream 1.4.0)
- Search streaming coalesces UI updates to avoid redraw bursts (upstream 1.4.0)
- Accessibility fallbacks for reduced motion preferences

### Fixed
- Download directory validation in settings (`set_config`)
- Torrent ID sanitization for cached `.torrent` metadata files
- Path re-validation on torrent resume and restore
- `SeedStatus::Missing` now persists correctly across restarts
- Search cache eviction (TTL + 200 entry cap)
- Sources without health data show "—" instead of misleading 0 seeders

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-09

### Changed
- Removed deprecated Ink TUI and TypeScript download stack; desktop app is the only download path
- Hardened Tauri security (CSP, scoped shell capabilities, download path validation)
- Expanded test coverage for search, sources, and Rust backend
- Added Dependabot and dependency audits in CI

## 1.4.8 — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Desktop app no longer hangs on startup when torrent restore blocks on unreachable trackers
- Search source pages decode declared charsets correctly, fixing mojibake in titles

### Fixed

- Search sidecar no longer trusts a random process on port 3847
